This is the rainforest crypto currency algorithm. It is designed to rebalance the mining power towards the users and not the big
corporations anymore. It achieves this by being extremely fast on modern 64-bit CPUs including low-power ones such as A53, still
efficient though not as fast on GPUs, and not affordable to implement at all on FPGAs or ASICs. It makes intensive use of
pseudo-random in-cache memory accesses and advanced instructions found in modern CPUs like AES, CRC, 64-bit divide, making
set-top-boxes and smartphones as fast as high-end PCs and as fast as mid-end GPUs.

It was presented and demoed on 2018-04-11 at the crypto-currency conference at Linz (Austria).

I was advised to use the MIT license, I'm no expert, if that doesn't suit you, please let me know.
