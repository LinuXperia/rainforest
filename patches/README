These are patches adding support for the Rainforest algorithm to existing products :

* smhasher-rf256.diff : for SMHasher, to validate the algorithm's robustness
* cpuminer-multi-134-rf256.diff : this is for version 1.3.4 of this popular CPU miner
* sgminer-gm-add-rainforest+precalc.diff : this is for the latest version of this GPU miner
* yiimp-rainforest.diff : this is for the latest version of this popular server

Support for Android wallets would be appreciated.
